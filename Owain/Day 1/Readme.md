Learning about Constants / Variables.
## Variable
A name given to a storage location in memory

For local varibles, use camelCase naming

int number;

type - identifier
int number;

## Constant 
an immutable value

For constants const int MaxZoom = 5; use PascalCase

Data
const float Pi = 3.14f;

To declare a constant you use the keyword const.
Then you set the type (float) and the identifier Pi and initialise it with a value 3.14f

## Identifiers
Cannot start with a number e.g. 1route

Cannot include white space e.g. first name

Cannot be a reserved keyword e.g. int

Always use meaningful names e.g. not fn for firstName


## Naming Conventions
camelCase - integars

PascalCase - constants

strHungarianNotation - not used in c#

## Primitive Types
