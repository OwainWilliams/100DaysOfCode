## Operators cont.

|               | Operator      | Example     | Same as |
| ------------- | ------------- |-------------|---------|
| Increment     | ++            | a + b       | a = a+1 |
| Decrement     | --            | a - b       | a = a-1 |


Postfix Increment

```
int a = 1;
int b = a++;

// a = 2, b = 1
// Because b = a, then a is incremented by 1
```

Prefix Incremement

```
int a = 1;
int b = ++a;

// a = 2, b = 2
// First a is increment by 1, then assigned to b. 
```

## Comparison Operators

|               | Operator      | Example     | 
| ------------- | ------------- |-------------|
| Equal         | ==            | a == b       |
| Not Equal     | !=            | a != b       |
| Greater than     | >            | a > b       |
| Greater than or equal to     | >=            | a >= b       |
| Less than     | <         | a < b       |
| Less than or equal to     | <=            | a <= b       |

## Assignment Operators


|               | Operator      | Example     | 
| ------------- | ------------- |-------------|
| Assignment        | =            | a = 1       |
| Addition assignment     | +=            | a += 3       |
| Subtract     | -=            | a > b       |
| Multiply     | *=            | a >= b       |
| Divide     | /=         | a < b       |

a += 3 is the same as a = a + 3
