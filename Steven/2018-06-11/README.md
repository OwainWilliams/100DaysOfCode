# Day 1

Refactored and commented my Azure Function auto-tweeter. Published the source code here: https://github.com/stvnhrlnd/100daysofcode-azure-functions

Still a really dirty script but it'll do for now.

## Notes

Learned how to:
- [Create a function in Azure that is triggered by a timer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-scheduled-function)
- Write a basic [CRON expression](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-timer#cron-expressions)
- Use [environment variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-dotnet-class-library#environment-variables) in functions
