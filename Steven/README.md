# #100DaysOfCode Challenge

Hi, I'm [Steven Harland](http://stevenhar.land/), a Northern Irish software engineer living in Edinburgh, Scotland.

This repo (or folder within a repo I should say) contains the log entries for my [#100DaysOfCode challenge](http://www.100daysofcode.com/). Each day has its own folder within which there is a README with a summary of what I did on that day along with any relevant notes and links. The summaries also get published to [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/stvnhrlnd) if you'd like to follow me there.
